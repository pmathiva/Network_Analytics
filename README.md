Sleep-disordered breathing (SDB) is a common and highly prevalent condition in children, affecting up to 27 percent of children, with a median in the 10 percent to 12 percent range. Rather than being an “all of nothing” condition, SDB is traditionally perceived as encompassing a wide spectrum of clinical severity – ranging from habitual snoring to obstructive sleep apnea syndrome (OSAS).

After reviewing your preliminary analysis regarding articles associated with the treatment  and outcomes of SDB, the research team is interested in identifying relevant patterns associated with a specific area of research (simply choose one of your findings from Case 1, for example SDB and Diabetes or ADHD) – the objective is to analyze the social network (identified with Primary Investigators), highlighting what research they are doing, who is working (co-authoring) with them, and who is citing their work.  Other useful information would be where (location) the work is being done, as well as when (timeframe) it was done.  Please don't limit yourself to the original 247 extracted text files from Case 1.
 
This case leverages Network Analytics to highlight important link information surrounding SDB research, such as: “who works with whom”, “who cites whom”, “who does research with whom”.
 
What additional patterns can you find in the data, which might otherwise be too complex to discover?
